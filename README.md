# rooMe
RooMe is an app that connects between people searching for roommates for their apartment and people searching to join an apartment. The app presents relevant apartments/roommates based on the user's preferences.
The app provides a simple interface for searching and communicating.

The general structure of the app:
The user can choose to be one of the two (either search for an apartment or a roommate) when first signing in.

Apartment searcher:
Home: The user sees all apartments relevant to his preferences (filters) that are searching for a roommate.
Edit profile: The user is advised to fill up his profile page entirely, for the roommate searchers see this data of his and it
is also a filtering data for the roommate searchers. For example-roommate searchers may want roommates above a certain age so this is a filter taken from the apartment searchers' profile.
Edit filters: The user is highly advised to fill these filters for they have a great influence on the apartments the user sees in his/hers home page.
Matches: In this tab the user will see apartments for which their owners (roommate searcher) have approved his request (sent as a like from the home tab). For privacy reasons, the phone number of each user is only seen when matched so they would be able to contact one another only after mutual approvement.

Roommate searcher:
Home: The user sees all apartment searchers relevant to his preferences (filters).
Edit profile: The user is advised to fill up his profile page entirely, for the apartment searchers see this data and it
is also a filtering data for the apartment searchers. For example-apartment searchers may want apartments in a certain location so this is a filter taken from the rommate searchers' profile.
Edit filters: The user is highly advised to fill these filters for they have a great influence on the roommate searchers the user sees in his/hers home page.
Matches: In this tab the user will see roommate searcher profiles which their request (sent as a like from the home tab) was approved. For privacy reasons, the phone number of each user is only seen when matched so they would be able to contact one another only after mutual approvement.
